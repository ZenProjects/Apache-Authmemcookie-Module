# What is "Auth MemCookie"?

`Auth MemCookie` is an Apache v2 Authentication and authorization modules are based on `cookie` Authentication mechanism.

The module doesnâ€™t make Authentication by it self, but verify if Authentication `the cookie` is valid for each url protected by the module. The module validate also if the `authenticated user` have authorization to access url.

`Authentication` is made externally by an Authentication `html form page` and all Authentication information necessary to the module a stored in [`memcached`](http://memcached.org/) identified by the cookie value `Authentication session id` by this login page.

# How it Works

## Phase 1 : The login Form

`Authentication` is made by a login form page.

This login page must authenticate the user with any authenticate source (ldap, /etc/password, file, database....) accessible to language of the page (php, perl, java... an ldap login page sample in php are in samples directory).

Then this page must set cookie that contains only a key the `Authentication unique id` of the `Authentication session`.

The login page must store authorization and user information of the authenticated user in [memcached](http://memcached.org/) identified by the cookie key `Authentication unique id`.

The login page can be developed in any language you want, but must be capable to use [memcached](http://memcached.org/) (they must have memcache client api for us)

## Phase 2 : The Apache v2 Module

After the user is logged, the Auth MemCookie module check on each protected page by apache ACL is the user is authenticated.

When authenticating a request Auth MemCookie module walks through the following steps:

1. Get the **`session id`**. The `session id` is stored in a cookie (by default named `AuthMemCookie`).

2. Get the **`session data`**. Auth MemCookie module fetches **`session data`** by looking up the session id on the [memcached](http://memcached.org/) server.

3. Verify the **`remote ip`**. Auth MemCookie module checks the ip address stored in the **`session data`** against the ip address of the current request. This step is optional, and can be disabled by setting the **`Auth_memCookie_MatchIP`** option to no.

4. Get username and groups from **`session data`**. The username is stored in the **`UserName`** field in the **`session data`** and the groups the user is a member of is stored in the Groups field.

5. Check username and groups against [`Require`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#require) configuration directives.  

If any of the steps 1-4 fails, then Auth MemCookie will return a **`HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED`** (401) Authorization Required error. A **`HTTP_FORBIDDEN`** (403) Forbidden error will be returned if the last step fails.

When a user is successfully authenticated, Auth MemCookie will store all the fields from the **`session data`** in environment variables accessible to the web page. Every field of the **`session data`** will be send http header **`MCAC_<field-name>`** to the value of the field. 

# *"Session data"* format stored in memcached

The **`session data`** stored in [memcached](http://memcached.org/) are composed with multiple line in form of **`name`** equal **`value`** ended by **`\r\n`**. some are mandatory, other are optional and the rest are information only (all this field are transmitted to the script language protect the module).

**`Session data`** format:

    UserName=<user name>\r\n
    Groups=<group name1>:<group name2>:...\r\n
    RemoteIP=<remote ip>\r\n
    Password=<password>\r\n
    Expiration=<expiration time>\r\n
    Email=<email>\r\n
    Name=<name>\r\n
    GivenName=<given name>\r\n

- **Username**: are mandatory.
- **Groups**: are mandatory, are used to check group in apache acl. if no group are know for the user, must be blank (Groups=\r\n)
- **RemoteIP**: are mandatory, used by remote ip check function in apache module.
- **Password**: are not mandatory, and is not recommended to store in memcached for security reson, but if stored, is sent to the script language protected by the module.
- The other fields are information only, but they are sent to the langage that are behind the module (via environement variable or http header).

The session field size is for the moment limited to 10 fields by default.

# Build dependency

You must have compiled and installed:

- [libevent](http://libevent.org/) use by [memcached](http://memcached.org/).

- [memcached](http://memcached.org/) the cache daemon it self.

- [libmemcached](http://libmemcached.org/) the C client API needed to compile the Apache Module.

- [autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html) the gnu autotool to rebuild configure script from `autoconf.ac` and m4 files.

# Compilation

```
# autoconf -f
# ./configure --with-apxs=/path/to/apache/httpd/bin/apxs --with-libmemcached=/path/to/libmemcached/
# make
# make install
```

After that the `mod_auth_memcookie.so` is generated in apache `modules` directory.

# How to configure Apache Module

## Module configuration option:

This option can be used in `location` or `directory` apache context.

- **Auth_memCookie_Memcached_Configuration**

    This configuration directive permit to configure libmemcached initialisation.
    The syntax of this directive value are defined her: http://docs.libmemcached.org/libmemcached_configuration.html

    With that directive you can specify a liste of ip or host adresse(s) and port `:` separed of memcache(s) daemon to be used.

    For exemple: 
    ```
    Auth_memCookie_Memcached_Configuration "--SERVER=host10.example.com:port1 --SERVER=host11.example.com:port2 --SERVER=host10.example.com:port3"
    ```
    
- **Auth_memCookie_Memcached_SessionObject_ExpireTime**

    Session object stored in memcached expiry time, in secondes. 

    Used only if `Auth_memCookie_Memcached_SessionObject_ExpiryReset` is set to `on`.

    Set to 3600 seconds by default.

- **Auth_memCookie_Memcached_SessionObject_ExpiryReset**

    Set to `off` to not reset object expiry time in memcache on each url, is set to `on` by default.

    By default on each request authenticated by the module, the object expiry in memcached of the `session data` are reset to make expiry base on inactivity, if set to `off` the expiry are based on session time length.

- **Auth_memCookie_SessionTableSize**

    Max number of element in session information table, is set to 10 by default.

- **Auth_memCookie_SetSessionHTTPHeader**

    Set to `on` to set session information to http header of the authenticated users, is set to `off` by default.
    Each session field are sended to backend. 
    Each session field name are prefixed by `Auth_memCookie_SetSessionHTTPHeaderPrefix` changed to uppercase.

- **Auth_memCookie_SetSessionHTTPHeaderEncode**

    Set to `on` to mime64 encode session information to http header, is set to `off` by default.

- **Auth_memCookie_SetSessionHTTPHeaderPrefix** 

    Set HTTP header prefix, is set to `MCAC_` by default.

- **Auth_memCookie_CookieName**

    Name of the cookie to used for check authentification, is set to `AuthMemCookie` by default.

- **Auth_memCookie_MatchIP_Mode**

    To check cookie ip adresse, Set to `1` to use `X-Forwarded-For` http header, to `2` to use `Via` http header, and to `3` to use apache `remote_ip`, is set to `0` by default to desactivate the ip check.

- **Auth_memCookie_GroupAuthoritative** (only on apache <2.4)

    Set to `off` to allow access control to be passed along to lower modules, for group acl check, is set to `on` by default.

- **Auth_memCookie_Authoritative**
 
    Set to `off` to allow access control to be passed along to lower modules, is set to `on` by default.

- **Auth_memCookie_SilmulateAuthBasic**

    Set to `off` to not fix `http header` and `auth_type` for simulating `auth basic` for scripting language like `php` authentication framework work, is set to `on` by default.

    with this option this $_SERVER variable are normaly set on php: 

    ```
      AUTH_TYPE = "basic"
      PHP_AUTH_USER = "user"
      PHP_AUTH_PW = "password"
    ```

- **Auth_memCookie_DisableNoStore**

    Set to `on` to stop the sending of a `Cache-Control` header set to `no-store` with the login screen. This allows the browser to cache the credentials, but at the risk of it being possible for the login form to be resubmitted and revealed to the backend server through XSS. Use at own risk.

# On the backend application

The application recieve this information: 

- `REMOTE_USER` are set to the user logged name
- `AUTHMEMCOOKIE_PREFIX` are set to value of `Auth_memCookie_SetSessionHTTPHeaderPrefix`
- `AUTHMEMCOOKIE_AUTH` are set to `yes` when protected, `no` when in public zone.

And all session field (prefixed by `Auth_memCookie_SetSessionHTTPHeaderPrefix`/`AUTHMEMCOOKIE_PREFIX`) if `Auth_memCookie_SetSessionHTTPHeader` is `on`.

And if `Auth_memCookie_SilmulateAuthBasic` is set, they recieve also this `$_SERVER` variable : 

```
  AUTH_TYPE = "basic"
  PHP_AUTH_USER = "user"
  PHP_AUTH_PW = "password"
```

# Apache 2.3/2.4 [authn/authz model](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/auth.html)

The module add some [`Require`/`authz`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_core.html#require) provider:

- **Require mcac-group**

    To limit access to groups specified in session (`groups` session field) by the login script.
    Use the same syntax than [`Require group`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_groupfile.html#requiredirectives).
    But `Require group` on apache 2.3/2.4 work only with [mod_authz_groupfile](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_groupfile.html).

    They also support multiple groups like that:
    ```
    Require mcac-group group1 group2 group3
    ```

    If one match on group of the `groups` session field they are granted.

- **Require mcac-public**

    They make possible to specify public access zone.
    
    In that zone authenticated or not are granted but authenticated can send session information to backend depend on `Auth_memCookie_SetSessionHTTPHeader` flag.

    ```
    <Location /publiczone>
      Require mcac-public
    </Location>
    ```

- **[Require valide-user](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_user.html#requiredirectives)** and **[Require user](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_user.html#requiredirectives)**

    All the two a provided by [mod_authz_user](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_user.html) core apache module.

## Sample to configure Apache v2.4 Module:

Configuration sample for using Auth_memcookie apache V2.4 module:

<Location />
    Auth_memCookie_CookieName myauthcookie
    Auth_memCookie_Memcached_Configuration --SERVER=127.0.0.1:11000

    # to redirect unauthorized user to the login page
    ErrorDocument 401 "/gestionuser/login.php"

    # to specify if the module are autoritative in this directory
    Auth_memCookie_Authoritative on
    # must be set without that the refuse authentification
    AuthType Cookie
    # must be set (apache mandatory) but not used by the module
    AuthName "My Login"
    require mcac-public
</Location>

</IfModule>

# to protect juste user authentification
<Location "/myprotectedurl">
    require valid-user
</Location>

# to protect acces to user in group1
<Location "/myprotectedurlgroup1">
    require mcac-group group1
</Location>
```

# Apache 2.0/2.2 [authn/authz model](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/auth.html)

- **Require group groupname [groupname]...**

    Only users with the specified groups can access the resource.

- **Require valid-user**

    Any valid user can access the resource.

- **Require user user_id [user_id]...**

    Only specified users can access the resource.

    all this directive are from [mod_auth_basic](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#require) module.
