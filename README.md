AuthMemCookie Apache Module
=============

The "Auth MemCookie" is an Apache v2.0 Authentication and authorization modules are based on "cookie" Authentication mechanism.

The module doesnâ€™t make Authentication by it self, but verify if Authentication "the cookie" is valid for each url protected by the module. The module validate also if the "authenticated user" have authorization to access url.

Authentication is made externally by an Authentication html form page and all Authentication information necessary to the module a stored in memcached identified by the cookie value "Authentication session id" by this login page.
